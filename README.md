# AIRBNB REPLICA

I have made a replica of Airbnb on mobile device (Ios and Android)

# FEATURES

- create an account
- update your user profile (username, email, profile pic and description)
- Displaying offers list from an API
- Geolocation (Plan from Apple and Google Maps from Google)

# ISSUES TO FIX

- Updating a profile required to change all infos to update
- Google Maps doesn't zoom on iOS so I use only Plan
- i need to add one picture and price from offer on the map
- Displaying full description with a button in offer view

# TOOLS

xCode and Android studio emulator with EXPO.
I used iPhone 14 Pro max and Pixel 4 to work on the app.
